# Student Grade Calculator

This project is a simple Java application that calculates a student's total marks, average percentage, and assigns grades based on the average percentage achieved in different subjects.

## Description

The Student Grade Calculator takes input in the form of marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject. It then calculates the total marks by summing up the marks obtained in all subjects. The average percentage is calculated by dividing the total marks by the total number of subjects.

Based on the average percentage achieved, the program assigns grades to the student. The grading system may vary, but typically grades are assigned as follows:

- 90% and above: A+
- 80% - 89%: A
- 70% - 79%: B+
- 60% - 69%: B
- 50% - 59%: C+
- Below 50%: Fail

The results including total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade are displayed to the user.
